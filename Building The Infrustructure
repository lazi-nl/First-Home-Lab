1.Virtual Os Configuartion
a) Windows Server 2022 (Domain controller)
Allocated Ram: 4 GB
Allocated CPUS: 2 
Allocated Memory: 50GB

b) Windows 10 Pro (Victim Machine)
Allocated Ram: 4 GB
Allocated CPUS: 2 
Allocated Memory: 50GB

2. Network Configuration
A virtual bridge(vboxnet0) was extablished to create an isolated "internal network' subnet.
Static IPs were assigned to the devices to create the internal network
host gateway: 192.168.56.1
Domain controller: 192.168.56.10
Victim Machine: 192.168.56.50

- Later a DHCP server was added to the domain controller. This was configured to handle dynamic IP assignments, eliminating the need to manually add ip addresses.

3.Identity & Access Management
-The lab was transitioned from a decentralized Workgroup model to a centalized Active Directory forest named lab.local
-This was done using the Add Roles and Features Wizard on the sever manager on the server

Domain User Provisioning(Powershell Scripts)
# Creating User 
$pass = Convert-To-SecureString "Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force
New-ADUser -Name "User 1" -SamAccountName "vuser" -UserprincipalName "vuser.lab.local" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword $pass

# Create security group
New-ADGroup -Name "LabUsers" -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope Global

# Adding the user to the security group
add-AdGroupMember -Identity "LabUsers" -Members "vuser"

On the Victim Machine the following powershell script was executed to automate joining the domain
# join lab.local and reboot
Add-Computer -DomainName "lab.local" -Credentials (Get-Credentials) -Restart

--> After the initail setup now it was time to check is my Kali Linux host Machine could reach the Domain Controller and similary the victim machine.
# Simple Ping
ping -c 3 192.168.56.10

The ping was succesful with 0 packet loss.
Now it was time to continue to the next step --->
